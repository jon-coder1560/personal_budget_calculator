# Personal Budget Calculator

A simple Java program that helps users understand their monthly spending.  
The program asks for monthly income and several expense amounts, then calculates:

- Total monthly expenses  
- Money left over after expenses  
- Percentage of income spent  

This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as:
- User input with `Scanner`
- Variables and data types
- Arithmetic operations
- Output formatting
- The input → processing → output model

## How It Works

1. The user enters their monthly income.  
2. The program asks for common expenses (such as rent, food, and transportation).  
3. It adds the expenses together.  
4. It subtracts the total from the income to find the remaining balance.  
5. It calculates what percentage of income was spent.  
6. It prints a summary of the results.

Enter your transportation cost: 150

Total expenses: 1750
Money left over: 1250
You spent 58.3% of your income.
