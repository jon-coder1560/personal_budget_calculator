# Personal Budget Calculator (Java & Python)
## NEEDS TO BE UPDATED!

A beginner‑friendly budgeting program implemented in **both Java and Python**.  
The program asks the user for their monthly income and several expense amounts, then calculates:

- Total monthly expenses  
- Money left over after expenses  
- Percentage of income spent  

This project demonstrates core programming concepts across two languages, including:

- User input handling  
- Variables and data types  
- Arithmetic expressions  
- Output formatting  
- The input → processing → output model

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### **Java Version**
- `Scanner` input  
- `int` and `double` variables  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Escape sequences  
- Console formatting  

### **Python Version**
- `input()` function  
- `float` and `int` types  
- Basic math  
- Formatted printing (f‑strings)  

Both versions reinforce the same computational thinking skills.

## 🧮 How It Works

1. The user enters their monthly income.  
2. The program asks for common expenses (rent, food, transportation, etc.).  
3. It adds all expenses together.  
4. It subtracts total expenses from income to find the remaining balance.  
5. It calculates what percentage of income was spent.  
6. It prints a clean summary of the results.

## 🧪 Example Output
```
Enter your monthly income: 3000
Enter your rent: 1200
Enter your food cost: 400
Enter your transportation cost: 150

Total expenses: $1750
Money left over: $1250
You spent 58.3% of your income.
```
